        <content>Dear Navrachanites, <br />
<br />
        As the years go by and Navrachana scales new heights, I thank God for continuing to bless us and giving me the vision, energy and zeal to take the School forward on the path of progress and glory. The ever-changing social order makes it imperative to use education as the most powerful tool to face life's challenges and to cope with the changes. India's wealth lies in the youth and the children. They are the creators of tomorrow and will shape the Nation. Navrachana has always been a pioneer in bringing about the desired change where education has been learner centric and the physical, mental, social, moral and emotional development has been all important. New technology, 21st century learner skills, exploring new teaching methods and making it relevant, promoting teamwork, creativity &amp; innovation and self-learning will remain the focus of the School. Spreading the spirit of compassion, empathy and inclusiveness is the need of the hour and Navrachana's mission in this regard has never changed. We have a proud history, a strong culture, a great bond between teacher&amp; taught and deep rooted values, which remain unshaken. Together we will keep the torch aflame and the flag flying high.<br />
